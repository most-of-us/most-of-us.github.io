## IRS CHURCH QUALIFICATION GUIDELINES

Below is a list of the 14 Points which the IRS uses as a guidlines to determine whether or not an entity can be called a 'church' and therefore be entitled to tax-exempt status.

The Universal Life Church Seminary has been working dilligently since its inception to meet the criterion for non-profit status with the IRS. I'm going to discuss how MOSTofUS meets each of these points.

1) Distinct legal existence
- The Ministry of Science & Technology in the United States will be incorporated in 2020. A President and Vice-President was selected at that time.
2) Recognized creed and form of worship
- We have a posted Declaration of Intent and Statement of Beliefs. The congregation of this ministry get regular communication in the form of emails and website postings.
3) Definite and distinct ecclesiastical government
- A single President, then Vice-Presidents, then Leaders, then Members.  All roles are considered associates of MOSTofUS.
4) Formal code of doctrine and discipline
- Our doctrine is clear and concise: To Do That Which is Right. If any of our associates choose to ignore that doctrine, they can be removed from membership in the Ministry.
5) Distinct religious history
- Created by Tim Dime in 2020.  MOSTofUS was formed after it was believed that science can prove or disprove everything with time and technology after technological breakthroughs made it possible to push scientific efforts forward.
6) Membership not associated with any other church or denomination
- While we don't require that any of our associates renounce membership in any other church to which they may belong, most of our ministers are exclusively members of the MOSTofUS.
7) Organization of ordained ministers
- The only ordained minister, at this point in time, is Tim Dime as the President of MOSTofUS.
8) Ordained ministers selected after completing prescribed courses of study
- Prescribed courses of study are to obtain a Bachelor of Science degree or like from an accredited University. 
9) Literature of its own
- This website contains growing literature to support the Ministry's cause.
10) Established places of worship
- Online through the resources provided through this website.
11) Regular congregations
- Our members congregate primarily in person, almost daily.
12) Regular religious services
-  Our service content is updated at least once a month and sometimes more often. Ministry associates are encouraged, on the site to submit resources for future services. We publish them on the website.
13) Sunday schools for the religious instruction of the young
- We believe that parents are the best ones to instruct their young in their beliefs. However, we also feel that providing instructional material may help parents or Sunday School teachers enhance their teaching abilities. We encourage our associates to share their favorite Sunday School lessons to share with the congregation.
14) Schools for the preparation of its members
- Public, private and home schooling systems with Technology and/or Science courses are recommended.  We feel it's essential that our Ministry of Science & Technology of the United States associates are well-educated and well-rounded.
