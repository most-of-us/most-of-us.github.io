##  A Modern Religion Based On The Following Core Principles:
* Faith that the understanding of all aspects of the physical world can be obtained through Science.  
* In time, through evidence obtained through Scientific Theory, everything has a scientific explanation.
* There is no final supernatural element, only that supernatural is a state in which an element cannot currently be proven or disproven by Science.
* Practicing the faith through the continuous education for yourself and educating others on all matters related to and backed by Science to foster the pursuit of truths.
