##  Our Belief:
* A faith that the understanding of all aspects of the physical world can be obtained through Science.  
* Many explanations are not known, but will be uncovered over time through Scientific Theory.
* The pursuit of truth can only be obtained through Science.
* There is no final supernatural element, only that supernatural is a state in which an element cannot currently be proven or disproven by Science.
