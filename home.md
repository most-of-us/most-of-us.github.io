##  Our Beliefs:
* Faith that the understanding of all aspects of the physical world can be obtained through Science.  
* In time, through evidence of Scientific Theory, everything has a scientific explanation.
* There is no final supernatural element, only that supernatural is a state in which an element cannot currently be proven or disproven by Science.
