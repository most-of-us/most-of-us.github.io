##DECLARATION OF FAITH

Our main purpose is to help any and all who ask to find truth, regardless of race, gender, or background.

We respect and value those who believe in in a deity. We also respect and value those who do not believe in a deity. We believe that all men and women should be given the opportunity to become useful citizens, do meaningful work, to encourage and help others find truth through science. We believe in allowing individual responsibility for growth.

We respect the Constitution of the United States of America.
